# Sambalpuri_Sieve_SLM_Evaluation
Probing Dialectal Drift and Cultural Grounding in Small Language Models: A Case Study on Standard Odia vs. Sambalpuri language. 
# Dialectal Robustness Evaluation

## Project Objective
This project evaluates the performance of Small Language Models (SLMs) like Microsoft Phi-3.5 on Sambalpuri, a low-resource dialect of Odia. The goal is to quantify "Standard Language Drift" and assess cultural grounding.

## Methodology
- **Anchor Language:** English
- **Gold Standard:** Expert-annotated (Standard Odia via Odia Lecturer and NET(JRF) qualifier; Sambalpuri via Native Speaker).
- **Target Models:** Microsoft Phi-3.5-mini, Gemini 1.5 Flash.

## Current Status
- [x] Project Setup
- [x] Data Collection (100/100 sentences annotated with linguistic features)
- [ ] Model Inference (In Progress: Running Phi-3.5 and Gemini)
- [ ] Error Analysis & Visualization
